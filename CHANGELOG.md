# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed
- `record_types.rs` pass 2b `variable_decl_by_name` map changed from last-wins
  (unconditional `insert`) to first-wins (`entry().or_insert()`) so that a
  procedure-local declaration always shadows an object-global with the same name
  — the correct AL innermost-scope rule and a prerequisite for the tempState
  backfill epoch (RV-5).

## [0.7.0] - 2026-05-06

### Added
- Anonymous, opt-out failure-diagnostics telemetry (Azure App Insights).
  - Captures resolution misses, parser errors, indexer issues, and handler outcomes.
  - All AL identifier names hashed with a per-installation 32-byte salt that stays local.
  - Three disable mechanisms: `DO_NOT_TRACK=1`, `--no-telemetry`, `~/.al-call-hierarchy/config.json` `telemetry.enabled=false`.
  - Off by default in debug, test, and CI builds.
  - LSP request `al-call-hierarchy/telemetryStatus` for runtime introspection.
  - Schema documented in `docs/telemetry.md`.
  - Fire-and-forget export: `BatchSpanProcessor` on a dedicated tokio current-thread runtime; HTTP calls are non-blocking, individual export failures are silently dropped, and LSP request threads are never affected by network state. 10s/5s reqwest timeouts cap any single HTTP call; shutdown is bounded to a 3s budget.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-03-22

### Changed
- **BREAKING: Migrated to tree-sitter-al V2 grammar** — all tree-sitter queries and parsing logic updated for the rewritten grammar
  - `procedure name:` and `trigger_declaration name:` now hold `(identifier)`/`(quoted_identifier)` directly (no `(name)`/`(trigger_name)` wrapper nodes)
  - `member_expression` field renamed from `property:` to `member:`
  - `parameter` field renamed from `parameter_name:` to `name:`
  - Individual `*_property` nodes replaced by unified `property` node with `name:` and `value:` fields
  - `preproc_split_codeunit_declaration` renamed to `preproc_split_declaration`
- **tree-sitter-al is now a git submodule** instead of an external sibling directory — clone with `--recurse-submodules`
- `build.rs` defaults to `tree-sitter-al` (submodule) instead of `../tree-sitter-al`

### Removed
- `field_access` query pattern — merged into `member_expression` with `quoted_identifier` as member
- `named_trigger` / `onrun_trigger` handling — unified into `trigger_declaration`
- `extract_trigger_name()` helper — no longer needed with V2 grammar
- `property_display_name()` helper — replaced by reading `property_name` field directly

### Fixed
- EventSubscriber detection now correctly handles V2 attribute-as-sibling model (attributes are siblings of procedures, not children)

## [0.2.0] - 2025-02-03

### Added
- **Event Subscriber Integration**: Event subscribers are now shown in the call hierarchy
  - Parses `[EventSubscriber]` attributes to extract publisher object and event name
  - Event subscribers appear as "callers" in `incomingCalls` for the subscribed events
  - Shows `[EventSubscriber]` tag in the call hierarchy detail

- **Code Lens Support**: Reference counts and quality metrics displayed above procedures
  - Shows "N references | complexity: X, lines: Y, params: Z" lens above each procedure/trigger definition
  - Displays cyclomatic complexity, line count, and parameter count for each procedure
  - Highlights procedures with 0 references as potential dead code
  - Click to navigate to the references (via `al-call-hierarchy.showReferences` command)

- **Unused Procedure Detection**: Diagnostics for procedures with no callers
  - Publishes `HINT` severity diagnostics for unused procedures
  - Excludes triggers and event subscribers (they're called implicitly)
  - Tagged with `UNNECESSARY` for IDE-specific rendering (strikethrough, etc.)

- **Code Quality Diagnostics**: Warnings for potential code quality issues
  - High fan-in warning: procedures called by more than 20 other procedures
  - Long method warning: procedures spanning more than 50 lines
  - Diagnostics published at `INFORMATION` severity

- **External .app dependency support**: The server now resolves calls to procedures defined in compiled .app packages
  - Automatically parses `app.json` to discover declared dependencies
  - Finds matching .app files in the `.alpackages` folder with version matching
  - Extracts procedure definitions from `SymbolReference.json` inside .app files
  - Shows "(from AppName)" in call hierarchy for resolved external calls
  - Supports all standard BC object types: Codeunits, Tables, Pages, Reports, etc.

### Changed
- **Memory optimization**: `ExternalSource.app_version` now uses interned `Symbol` instead of `String`, reducing memory usage when loading large .app dependencies (~50-100MB savings for BC base apps)

### New capabilities
- `textDocument/codeLens` - Returns reference counts for all procedures in a file
- Diagnostics publishing via `textDocument/publishDiagnostics`

### New modules
- `app_package.rs` - Parser for .app files (ZIP with 40-byte NAVX header)
- `dependencies.rs` - Dependency discovery and resolution from app.json

### Dependencies
- Added `zip` crate for .app file extraction
- Added `roxmltree` crate for NavxManifest.xml parsing
