//! Shared big-stack execution for anywhere the `al_syntax` lowerer runs.
//!
//! `src/snapshot/parse.rs` documented an OBSERVED stack overflow lowering real
//! BaseApp source on rayon's default worker stack (~1 MiB on Windows) and worked
//! around it with a local 32 MiB rayon thread pool — the ONLY hardened
//! `al_syntax::parse` call site in the repo before T2.1. Every OTHER site running
//! the same recursive lowerer was unhardened: the LSP indexer (global rayon
//! pool), `didSave` (the LSP main thread, ~1 MiB on Windows), the file-watcher
//! thread, CLI `--analyze`, and the engine's sequential per-workspace parse loops
//! (`aldump` / `alsem`, also CLI-main-thread-driven). This module generalizes the
//! one working mitigation into the ONE place every such call site routes through.
//!
//! `crates/al-syntax`'s lowerer ALSO carries its own depth budget now
//! (`MAX_LOWER_DEPTH`, fails closed to a `SyntaxIssue` past ~128 nesting levels),
//! as does the engine's CFG walker (`MAX_CFG_WALK_DEPTH`) — the big stack here is
//! belt-and-suspenders defense in depth, not load-bearing.

/// Worker stack size for anywhere the `al_syntax` lowerer runs. ~32x the
/// smallest OS default thread stack this process runs on (the Windows main
/// thread, ~1 MiB), leaving generous headroom for the deepest known-real
/// nesting (Base Application source). The exact maximum required depth is
/// unmeasured; revisit if BC codebase complexity grows substantially.
