//! `LspSnapshot` (T3 Task 8): the immutable, batch-built, owned-derived-index
//! snapshot the migrated LSP server serves queries from — the arc's
//! structural centerpiece.
//!
//! [`LspSnapshot::build_full`] composes the engine primitives landed by
//! earlier T3 tasks (`SnapshotBuilder` → `parse_snapshot` → `build_dep_layer`/
//! `assemble_program_graph` [Task 5] → per-file `resolve_file_obligations`
//! [Task 6] → `def_surface_fingerprint` [Task 7] → `emit_event_flow_edges`)
//! into one self-contained, `Arc`-shareable value: every field is OWNED data
//! (never a borrow into another field), so the whole snapshot can be handed
//! to a query thread as `Arc<LspSnapshot>` without any lifetime entanglement.
//!
//! # Ownership law (spec §3 / H-10 lesson)
//!
//! `ResolveIndex`/`DeclSurface`/the `ObjectNodeId → &ObjectNode` map all BORROW
//! `graph`/`parsed` and are built TRANSIENTLY inside [`LspSnapshot::build_full`]
//! — they never appear as fields on `LspSnapshot` itself (that would make the
//! struct self-referential). [`build_incoming`] is the one INDEX that IS
//! derived and stored: it is rebuilt WHOLESALE on every `build_full` call,
//! never incrementally edited — a future incremental updater (Task 9) always
