//! Recompute-diff-publish-clear diagnostics engine on the engine-backed
//! `LspSnapshot` (T3 Task 12) — the replacement for `src/server.rs`'s
//! `publish_all_diagnostics`/`get_code_quality_diagnostics` +
//! `src/handlers.rs`'s `get_unused_procedure_diagnostics`, cut over at Task 15.
//!
//! [`compute_all`] recomputes every diagnostic (unused-procedure + code
//! quality) from scratch on every call — no incremental diagnostic state —
//! and [`DiagnosticsState::diff`] is the ONLY place that compares against
//! what was last published, emitting exactly the `(uri, diagnostics)` pairs
//! that changed, INCLUDING a uri whose diagnostics dropped to zero (legacy's
//! `publish_all_diagnostics` never did this: it only ever published
//! non-empty file buckets, so a fixed procedure's stale "unused" hint would
//! linger in the editor until the NEXT unrelated finding in that same file
//! happened to overwrite it — see that function's doc for the gap this
//! closes).
//!
//! # Unused-procedure rule inventory (task brief Step 1 — binding)
//!
//! Ported from `src/indexer.rs:159-218` (attribute-driven exclusions) +
//! `src/graph.rs:888-905`/`865-886` (`get_unused_procedures`/
//! `get_incoming_call_count`), each rule keeping its legacy pinned test name
//! for traceability:
//!
//! | # | Rule | Legacy mechanism | Legacy test | Engine mechanism |
//! |---|------|------------------|-------------|-------------------|
//! | R1 | Only `Procedure`-kind routines are eligible (triggers excluded) | `graph.rs`'s `get_unused_procedures` filters `def.kind == DefinitionKind::Procedure` | (structural; exercised by every other test below, which all use non-trigger fixtures) | `routine.kind == RoutineKind::Procedure` on the `RoutineDecl` correlated via [`crate::lsp::lens::find_routine_by_origin`] |
//! | R2 | An `[EventSubscriber]` routine is never flagged (invoked implicitly by its publisher) | `indexer.rs` reclassifies its `DefinitionKind` to `EventSubscriber`, excluded by R1's kind filter | `test_event_subscriber_not_flagged_unused` | **SUBSUMED** — no attribute check at all. [`crate::lsp::lens::effective_incoming_count`] already counts an `EventFlow` edge targeting this routine (`LspSnapshot::incoming`), so a genuinely-wired subscriber falls out of the zero-incoming check naturally. See "Semantic difference (a)" below. |
//! | R3 | Framework-invoked test methods/handlers (`[Test]`, `[ConfirmHandler]`, `[MessageHandler]`, `[PageHandler]`, `[ModalPageHandler]`, `[ReportHandler]`, `[RequestPageHandler]`, `[SendNotificationHandler]`, `[RecallNotificationHandler]`, `[SessionSettingsHandler]`, `[StrMenuHandler]`, `[FilterPageHandler]`, `[HyperlinkHandler]`) marked `implicitly_invoked` | `parser.rs`'s `is_framework_invocation_attribute` + `indexer.rs:187-197` | `test_test_method_not_flagged_unused`, `test_test_handler_not_flagged_unused` | Reuses the SAME `crate::analysis::is_framework_invocation_attribute` (relocated from `parser.rs` in the review fix-wave — see that module's doc) against `RoutineDecl.attributes` (already lowercased) |
//! | R4 | `[IntegrationEvent]`/`[BusinessEvent]` publishers are ALWAYS excluded — their real subscribers typically live in downstream apps this workspace never loads | `indexer.rs:199-218` marks them `implicitly_invoked` unconditionally | `test_public_event_publishers_not_flagged` | Reuses `program::resolve::event::is_event_publisher` — `Some(PublisherKind::Integration)`/`Some(PublisherKind::Business)` excludes unconditionally, regardless of incoming count |
//! | R5 | `[InternalEvent]` is NOT auto-excluded: flagged unless subscribed OR raised (its subscribers must live in the SAME app, so they're always visible) | `graph.rs`'s `get_incoming_call_count` = direct calls + `event_subscriptions.get(qname).len()` | `test_orphan_internal_event_is_flagged`, `test_subscribed_or_raised_internal_event_not_flagged` | Falls through to the SAME zero-`effective_incoming_count` check every ordinary procedure uses — no special case needed (see that function's doc) |
//! | R6 | An interface method's own SIGNATURE is never flagged — it can never itself be a call target (dispatch always resolves to an IMPLEMENTING object's own routine, a distinct `RoutineNodeId`), so it structurally always shows zero incoming regardless of real usage | **NONE — legacy shared this exact false positive.** `graph.rs`'s `get_unused_procedures` never special-cased an Interface-kind object either | (none — a review-fix-wave finding, not a legacy-pinned case; NEW_BETTER, adjudicated in the T3 Task-12 review fix-wave, not present in either engine before) | `decl.id.object.kind == ObjectKind::Interface` — no rule applies to the IMPLEMENTING codeunit's own routine, which stays subject to every rule above |
//!
//! No PORT-GAP was found for R1-R5: every legacy rule's input data (routine
//! kind, attribute names, incoming-edge evidence) is available on the engine
//! side, either directly on `RoutineDecl` (kind, `attributes`) or via
//! `LspSnapshot`'s edge indexes. R6 is a NEW rule neither engine had —
//! see its table row.
//!
//! ## Known semantic differences (deliberate, not bugs)
//!
//! (a) **A subscriber routine** is "used" because [`effective_incoming_count`]
//!     finds a real `EventFlow` edge targeting it — NOT because of a blanket
//!     `[EventSubscriber]`-attribute exclusion. A subscription whose
//!     publisher/event name typo's or doesn't resolve to any real publisher
//!     produces NO edge, so the engine version correctly flags it as unused
//!     where legacy's attribute-blanket rule never could — a precision
//!     improvement, not a preserved behavior, for the (documented, tested)
//!     well-formed case the two engines agree.
//! (b) **A publisher routine** is NOT "used" merely because it appears as the
//!     `from` of an `EventFlow` edge — `emit_event_flow_edges` unconditionally
//!     emits one edge per publisher declaration even with zero subscribers, so
//!     edge PRESENCE is not usage evidence. [`effective_incoming_count`] sums
//!     `edge.routes.len()` (the REAL resolved-subscriber count) for exactly
//!     this reason — only a publisher with ≥1 real subscriber, or a direct
//!     call/raise landing in `snap.incoming`, counts as used. This mirrors
//!     legacy's OWN semantics (`event_subscriptions.get(qname).len()` counts
//!     subscriptions, not mere event declarations) rather than the mechanism.
//!
//! # Diagnostic codes/severities/messages
//!
//! Ported byte-for-byte from `src/handlers.rs:600-635`
//! (`get_unused_procedure_diagnostics`) and `src/server.rs:353-506`
//! (`get_code_quality_diagnostics`) — see [`push_quality_diagnostics`] and
//! [`unused_procedure_diagnostic`] for the exact strings.
