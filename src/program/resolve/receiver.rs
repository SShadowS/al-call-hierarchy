//! Receiver-type lattice and Phase-A inference for member-call resolution.
//!
//! # Overview
//!
//! Member-call resolution (Phase B) dispatches on the STATIC TYPE of the receiver
//! expression. This module provides:
//! - [`ReceiverType`] — the lattice value Phase B dispatches on.
//! - [`FrameworkKind`] — the platform/framework data-type discriminant.
//! - [`ParsedType`] — intermediate result of [`classify_type_text`] (string→shape,
//!   no graph access).
//! - [`classify_type_text`] — pure string parse of a declared type string.
//! - [`infer_receiver_type`] — Phase A: infer the receiver type for a member call.
//!
//! # Phase A inference order
//!
//! Given a lowercased receiver name `receiver_lc`, inference proceeds:
//!
//! 0. **`CurrPage.<part>.Page` subpage-instance receivers** — a page control's
//!    (`part(<part>; <SubPage>)`) SUBPAGE INSTANCE, distinct from the CONTROL
//!    itself (`CurrPage.<part>` with no `.Page`, which addresses structural
//!    control methods like `.Update`/`.Visible` and is NOT resolved here).
//!    Only the exact `<part>.Page` shape (one control segment, one trailing
//!    `.Page` accessor) resolves, and only for a `Part` control whose target
//!    resolves unambiguously; a `SystemPart`/`UserControl`, a bare part, a
//!    deeper chain, or an unresolved/ambiguous target all fall through to
//!    `Unknown` (see [`infer_receiver_type`]'s Step 0).
//! 1. **Singletons** — hardcoded platform names (`currpage`, `session`, `this`, …)
//!    that are never declared as AL variables; returns immediately.
//! 2. **Variable lookup** — searches `routine.params` then `routine.locals` then
//!    `object_globals` by lowercased name → calls [`classify_type_text`] on the
//!    declared type → resolves Record table names and Object names against the graph.
//!    When the receiver name is `rec`/`xrec`, a variable with that name shadows
//!    the implicit-Rec step (a Codeunit routine may declare `var Rec: Record
//!    Customer`; the declared type is used in that case).
//! 3. **Implicit Rec / xRec** — two sub-cases, in order, both reached only on a
//!    Step 2 miss (a variable/param/global ALWAYS shadows the implicit Rec,
//!    whether by identity or by field — AL scoping; see Step 2's quote-parity
//!    fix, which is what makes this precedence correctly enforceable for a
//!    quoted name):
//!    - **3a. Bare quoted-field receiver** (record-field chains plan Task 4) —
//!      when the receiver is a QUOTED identifier and the enclosing object is a
//!      Table or TableExtension, looks the name up in the implicit-Rec table's
//!      visibility-scoped field surface (`ResolveIndex::field_in_table`) and
//!      types by the field's declared type. A same-named ROUTINE anywhere in
//!      that same visibility-scoped table surface
//!      (`ResolveIndex::table_scope_has_routine`) declines FIRST — AL's
//!      parens are optional on a zero-argument call, so a bare `Member` AST
//!      node is structurally ambiguous between a field access and a
//!      parens-less procedure call, and this step must never guess between
//!      them. Also gated on `WithState::NoWithProven` (mirrors
//!      [`crate::program::resolve::resolver::resolve_bare`]'s own Step 3
//!      implicit-Rec with-guard). Any other object kind, an unquoted
//!      receiver, a field-name miss, or an ambiguous/duplicate field all
//!      decline (fall through to 3b, never guessed) — quoted-only is
//!      deliberate undercoverage, an unquoted bare field reference is
//!      deferred to a future task.
//!    - **3b. `rec`/`xrec` identity** — resolves to the enclosing object's
//!      implicit record type (Table self-id, TableExtension base,
//!      Page/PageExtension via `SourceTable`, Codeunit via `TableNo` —
//!      topology-aware, fail-closed through `ResolveIndex::resolve_object_ref`,
//!      see [`infer_implicit_rec`] — or `Record{None}` for
//!      Report/ReportExtension, whose implicit Rec is per-dataitem scoped
//!      rather than object-level and is not yet modeled). A Codeunit with no
//!      `TableNo` declared at all (including `Subtype = Test`/`TestRunner`,
//!      which never declares one) has no implicit-Rec entity to type and
//!      returns `Unknown`; every other object kind not listed above
//!      (Report/ReportExtension aside) also returns `Unknown`.
//! 4. **Static framework type name** — when the receiver name matches a framework
//!    type name (e.g. `XmlDocument`, `Text`, `File`, `Version`) and no variable was
//!    found, type it as `Framework(kind)` so Phase B dispatches the static method
//!    via the builtin catalog.
//! 5. **Compound call-result receiver (`Func().Method()`)** — beyond-1B.3b
//!    Task 3. Only engages when `receiver_expr` carries a structured
//!    `ExprKind::Call{function, args}` node whose `function` is a BARE
//!    identifier (never dotted/member — a `Obj.Method().X()` cross-object
//!    chain declines HERE, at Step 5, and falls through to Step 6's
//!    cross-object-chain arm instead, plan v2.1 Task 3). Fail-closed, in order:
//!    (a) a caller param/local/global named identically to `function` SHADOWS
//!    it in AL (`resolve_bare` cannot see variables) — any such shadow
//!    declines immediately; (b) otherwise `function` is typed by calling
//!    [`crate::program::resolve::resolver::resolve_bare`] as a TYPE QUERY
//!    (reusing its own-object/extension-base/implicit-Rec/builtin precedence,
//!    ambiguity declines, and with-guard) — anything other than exactly one
//!    route to a `RouteTarget::Routine` declines; (c) that routine's
//!    `graph.routines[..].return_type` must be `Some` and parse (via
//!    [`classify_type_text`]) to a non-`Primitive` shape — a `None` or scalar
//!    return declines; the parsed type is then resolved to a receiver exactly
//!    like Step 2's declared-variable path (via [`parsed_type_to_receiver`]),
//!    inheriting its fail-closed cross-app-ambiguous-object decline. Only
//!    engaged when the caller passes a `bare_ctx` (full end-to-end resolution
//!    via `resolve_full_program`); callers with no `BodyMap`/`WithState` in
//!    scope (tests, `semantic_golden.rs`) pass `None` and this step is a no-op
//!    — resolution-neutral for them, exactly like `receiver_expr` itself.
//! 6. **Compound framework property/method + `this.<rest>` receiver**
//!    (beyond-1B.3b Task 4). Only engages when `receiver_expr` (Task 2) is
//!    populated — unlike Step 5, this step does NOT need `bare_ctx` (it never
//!    calls `resolve_bare`), so it also fires for callers that supply
//!    `receiver_expr` but not `bare_ctx`. Two independent AST-based sub-cases,
//!    both operating on the STRUCTURED `Expr` node (never `receiver_text`
//!    string-splitting): (a) `<Framework>.<Prop>` / `<Framework>.<Method(..)>`
//!    — the receiver is `ExprKind::Member{object, member}` (property form) or
//!    `ExprKind::Call{function: Member{object, member}, args}` (method-call
//!    form); `object` is recursively typed via the AST-native
//!    [`infer_receiver_type_for_expr`] helper, and if it resolves to
//!    `Framework(kind)`, the versioned [`framework_return_kind`] table maps
//!    `(kind, member_lc, is_method, arity)` to the returned kind — a table
//!    miss (wrong member, wrong form, wrong arity) declines. (b) `this.<rest>`
//!    — when `object` is the bare `this` identifier, `member` is resolved
//!    against a SELF-ONLY scope (`object_globals` only — never
//!    `routine.params`/`routine.locals`, per AL's documented `this.` semantics
//!    of addressing only "methods and globals within the same object"); a
//!    `this.<method>(..)` CALL form (dispatching a same-object procedure's
//!    return type) is deliberately NOT handled here — declines — since typing
//!    it correctly needs `resolve_bare`-style routine lookup, out of this
//!    step's scope. See [`infer_receiver_type_for_expr`] for the full
//!    recursion. (c) `<RecordRef|FieldRef|KeyRef>.<Method(..)>` (Task 4,
//!    chain-tables plan) — the SAME recursive base-typing as (a); if it
//!    resolves to `RecordRef`/`FieldRef`/`KeyRef`, the versioned
//!    [`recordref_family_return_kind`] table (a DISTINCT family from
//!    `framework_return_kind`, same fail-closed table-miss-declines
//!    contract) maps `(kind, member_lc, is_method, arity)` to the returned
//!    `*Ref` kind — e.g. `RecordRef.KeyIndex(1).FieldIndex(1)`.
//! 7. **Unknown** — no positive typing found.
//!
//! # Clean-room note
//!
//! This mirrors the logic of L3's `infer_receiver_type` in
//! `src/engine/l3/receiver_type.rs` but is written fresh over the IR
//! (`RoutineDecl`/`VarDecl`/`Param`) and `ProgramGraph`/`ResolveIndex`, carrying
//! `ObjectNodeId`s instead of L3 string IDs.

/// Phase A: infer the [`ReceiverType`] of a member-call receiver expression.
///
/// `receiver_lc` is the lowercased receiver text: usually a simple identifier,
/// but Step 0 also recognizes the `currpage.<part>.page` compound form (a
/// subpage-instance receiver) — any other compound expression that reaches here
/// unrecognized falls through to `Unknown` (fail-closed).
///
/// Inference order:
/// 0. **`CurrPage.<part>.Page` subpage-instance receivers** — see the module
///    doc's Step 0. Checked first because it is a COMPOUND (dotted) receiver
///    text that none of steps 1-4 would otherwise positively type.
/// 1. **Singletons** — `this`, `currpage`/`page`, `currreport`/`report`, and
///    other platform-provided names that are never declared as AL variables.
/// 2. **Variable lookup** — `routine.params` → `routine.locals` →
///    `object_globals`, matched by lowercased name; the declared type is
///    classified via [`classify_type_text`] and names are resolved against the
///    graph.  A variable named `rec`/`xrec` (idiomatic in Codeunits) is found
///    here and classified by its declared type, shadowing the implicit-Rec step.
/// 3. **Implicit Rec / xRec** — only when no variable named `rec`/`xrec` was
///    found in step 2: resolves to the object's implicit record type; returns
///    `Unknown` for object kinds with no implicit record (e.g. Codeunit).
/// 4. **Static framework type name** — bare identifier matching a framework type
///    (`XmlDocument`, `Text`, `File`, `Version`, …) with no variable found;
///    returned as `Framework(kind)`.
/// 5. **Compound call-result receiver (`Func().Method()`)** — see the module
///    doc's Step 5. Requires both `receiver_expr` (Task 2) and `bare_ctx`
///    (Task 3) to be populated; a no-op otherwise.
/// 6. **Compound framework property/method + `this.<rest>` receiver** — see
///    the module doc's Step 6. Requires only `receiver_expr` (Task 2); a
///    no-op otherwise.
/// 7. **Unknown** — no positive typing found.
///
/// # `receiver_expr` (Task 2 enabling primitive)
///
/// `receiver_expr` carries the PARSED receiver `Expr` — `Some((file, id))` when
/// the call site's [`CalleeShape::Member`] populated a `receiver` `ExprId`
/// (`file.ir.expr(id)` recovers the structured node: `ExprKind::Call{..}` /
/// `Member{..}` / …), `None` when the caller has no such node in scope (e.g.
/// the `RecordOp` shape, which does not carry one). Steps 0-4 are UNCHANGED by
/// this parameter and continue to dispatch purely on `receiver_lc`; Step 5
/// (Task 3) is the first consumer.
///
/// # `bare_ctx` (Task 3 enabling primitive)

/// resolution path); `None` for callers with no such context in scope (unit

/// 4. **Non-scalar return-type guard** — the resolved routine's

///    a non-`Primitive` shape; `None` (no declared return type) or a scalar
///    primitive (`Integer`, `Boolean`, …) declines — nothing to dispatch a
