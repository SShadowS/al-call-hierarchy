//! Port of al-sem `src/digest/conditionality.ts`.
//!
//! Conditionality captures how reliably an effect fires relative to the
//! routine's normal (success) exit path.
//!
//! ## Lattice (restrictiveness rank, 0 = least restrictive)
//!   unconditional-on-success → rank 0
//!   conditional              → rank 1
//!   loop-body                → rank 2
//!   guarded-by-IsHandled     → rank 3
//!   error-path               → rank 4
//!   unknown (contaminates — not ranked)
//!
//! ## path conditionality
//!   Most-restrictive along the path; any "unknown" contaminates.
//!
//! ## effect conditionality
//!   Least-restrictive across all paths; if ALL paths are "unknown" OR
//!   truncated && no unconditional path → "unknown".
